# Technomancy

We created a magic fantasy mobile game where enemies spawn in the real world around you and then you have to run, dodge, and fire your spells at them to survive! The enemies will actively try to follow you around and even encircle you while flying monsters will try to get you from afar using their spells! You fire spells at them by gesturing with your hand as a proper sorcerer would do!

## Tech

To achieve this awesomeness we're using two amazing features of the Huawei AR engine. The first feature is gesture recognition where the engine is actively scanning for certain predefined gestures using its machine learning model. We programmed certain gestures to fire certain spells at the direction of casting. The second feature is plane scanning. The engine scans the environment around the player and it detects planes, floors, ceilings, and other surfaces. We use this data to place the enemies in the real world and to move them around in such a way so that it feels like they're there trying to get you!


## Backstory

We are International students who had our fair share of loneliness. We got together and participated in this event to have fun and learn. We chose the Huawei challenge as it's the most unrestrictive challenge that allows for creativity and innovation as well as the CGI challenge. To spice it up, we decided to make a game in Augmented Reality using the Huawei AR engine.

## Process

The start was very bumpy as the Huawei AR engine is very innovative and has cutting-edge technology but the downside of such awesome capabilities is that it's in its early stages which means it's lacking documentation. We got stuck immediately at the beginning as we could not even run the example code for the engine. Thankfully, through the help of the awesome Huawei team on site, we were able to find the bug and fix it.


## Goals and the Future

First and Foremost, We participated to have fun and enjoy ourselves. This goal was achieved!
When people feel lonely, they tend to gravitate towards their rooms where they disappear. One thing leads to another and you're not moving that much anymore which makes the matter worse. Not with this game around! This game keeps you on your toes as you have to actively move your body and run away or dodge danger. This will keep you physically active long enough until the sun shines again. Discover new technologies and challenge ourselves by getting out of our comfort zone.

At this point of our development cycle, we're happy to say we're satisfied with what we were able to pull off in the given time frame. The game is functional and is fun to play. This doesn't mean that there isn't more to do, however. The game could grow and get better. There's also the possibility of implementing AR multiplayer which will help in better achieving our second goal. If you're on-site, don't forget to stop by and try out our game!
